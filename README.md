# linkchecker

PHP program to check URLs.

## Project setup

Standard config files for linting and testing are copied into place from a GitHub repository called
[config-setup](https://github.com/douglasgreen/config-setup). See that project's README page for
details.

## Usage

1. Copy `config.ini.sample` to `config.ini` and edit it.
2. Run `bin/check` with the config file as the argument.

For example:

```
bin/check config.ini
```
